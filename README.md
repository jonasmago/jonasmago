I am a cognitive neuroscientist and wellbeing aficionado, interested in the cognitive mechanisms underlying human flourishing. My research investigates contemplative practices that aim to bring about wholesome states of mind – from meditation and prayer to collective cultural rituals and psychedelic therapies. I work from an interdisciplinary perspective, combining cognitive, neurobiological, computational, and phenomenological approaches to shed light on mechanisms of self-regulation. I am currently pursuing my doctoral studies in [Neuroscience at McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/ipn/), supervised by [Dr. Michael Lifshitz](https://www.mcgill.ca/tcpsych/faculty/michael-lifshitz) and co-supervised by [Prof. Dr. Karl Friston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_J._Friston). Previously, I completed a master’s in [Mind, Language, and Embodied Cognition](https://www.ed.ac.uk/studying/postgraduate/degrees/index.php?r=site/view&edition=2023&id=655) at the University of Edinburgh (UK) and undergraduate studies in [Liberal Arts and Sciences](https://curriculum.maastrichtuniversity.nl/education/bachelor/university-college-maastricht) at the University College Maastricht (Netherlands).
